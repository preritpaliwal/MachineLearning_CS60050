Directory for the `second` and final assignment of Machine Learning course (CS60050) offered in Autumn semester 2022, Department of CSE, IIT Kharagpur.

## Getting started

Read the assignment problem statement from [Assignment_2.pdf](/assignment_2/Assignment_2.pdf)

Dataset is provided here- [Dataset_A.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine) and its description in [Dataset_A_Description.pdf](/assignment_2/Dataset_A_Description.pdf)

```

(In case of an error, notice the required packages for running the files are- `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `sklearn`). Install them individually if the above command fails (version conflict)

## Solution

- [Q1.py](/Asgn2/Q1.py) is the submission file for the first question
- [Q2.py](/Asgn2/Q2.py) is the submission file for the second question

- Run these files individually to get the output on terminal and output files.

```shell
python Q1.py
python Q2.py
```

- [learning_rate_vs_accuracy](/assignment_2/learning_rate_vs_accuracy.png) conatins the plot of learning rate vs accuracy of MLP model.
